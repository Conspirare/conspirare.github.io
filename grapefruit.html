						<h3>Where did they come from where did they go</h3>
						<p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>

				<h2>Grapefruit Benefits </h2>
						<h3>What makes grapefruits so great?</h3>
						<p>Grapefruits have multiple health benefits, as they contain many different minerals and vitamins that are essential to human beings, such as vitamin A and vitamin C. Half a grapefruit provides 80% of your daily recommended Vitamin C intake, and 6% of Vitamin A. <a href="https://www.webmd.com/food-recipes/features/pink-grapefruit-nutrition-facts">[Source]</a><p> Some of the health benefits are as following:</p>
							<br>
							<p><b>Reduced risk of type 2 diabetes</b><br>
							Consuming grapefruit (not grapefruit juice!) was found to reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3978819/">[Source]</a></p>
							
							
							<blockquote cite="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3978819/">..we found that the associations with risk of type 2 diabetes differed significantly among individual fruits: greater consumption of blueberries, grapes, apples, bananas, and grapefruit were significantly associated with a reduced risk of type 2 diabetes.</blockquote>
							<br>
							<p><b>Helps prevent sun damage and skin aging</b><br>
							Collagen is one of the most important building blocks when it comes to skin, and a part of the process of creating collagen uses vitamin C which is abundant in citrus fruits, such as grapefruit. <a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/collagen#nutrients-that-increase-collagen">[Source]</a></p>
						<p>One study found that Vitamin C could help with damaged skin and signs of aging. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5579659/">[Source]</a>
							<blockquote cite="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5579659/">The provision of vitamin C to the skin greatly assists wound healing and minimises raised scar formation.</blockquote>
						
						<blockquote cite="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5579659/">Signs of aging in human skin can be ameliorated* through the provision of vitamin C.
